# NeurIPS-Polymer-Challenge-Bronze-Predictor
This repository contains my solution for the **NeurIPS - Open Polymer Prediction 2025** competition, focusing on predicting key polymer properties from molecular structures. The solution achieved **Bronze Medal** performance with sophisticated molecular feature engineering and ensemble learning approaches.
